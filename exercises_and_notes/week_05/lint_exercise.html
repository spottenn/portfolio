<h1>Lint Exercise</h1>
<ul>
    <li>Researched linting packages and decided on ESLint due to its customization options and integration with my IDE
        of choice for web development JetBrains PhpStorm.
    </li>
    <li>Installed Node.js, and therefore npm, on my local machine.</li>
    <li>Ran <code>npm init</code> on portfolio project</li>
    <li>Installed ESLint as a local development dependency using npm.</li>
    <li>Ran <code>eslint --init</code> on portfolio project</li>
    <li>Enabled ESLint in PHPStorm using default configuration, which also means that all new JavaScript files will be
        analysed by ESLint in the editor as they are typed.
    </li>
    <li>Used ESLint and PhpStorm code inspection to check and fix the existing JavaScript in this portfolio.</li>
    <li>Added the proper files to version control (Git) and the
        <a href="https://github.com/spottenn/portfolio">portfolio repository</a> to enable easy
        installation/initialization in the future
    </li>
</ul>
